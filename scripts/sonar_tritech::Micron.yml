# The timeout for receiving head data
#
# The Micron is a request/receive device. I.e. this component must send a
# request to acquire data, and receives it. While a request is "in flight",
# one should not re-request data.
#
# This parameter tells the component at which point it should assume that it
# won't receive the head data it is expecting, and should re-request a new
# acquisition. This is used to account for e.g. errors on the communication
# line.
#
# It defaults to one second
